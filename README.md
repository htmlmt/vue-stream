## URLs to test
In order to see a stream or activity items below the stream, you'll need to add a participantID parameter that corresponds to a participant on try.donordrive.com with a stream (only Twitch for now, will update to pull in Mixer and YouTube) and/or activity items.

Adding participantID=15882 will show activity items.
Adding participantID=19461 will show a stream.

## Airtable API key and base ID
To show icons, I'll need to send you an API key and base ID for Airtable, where I'm hosting a prototype for a design system repository. Send me an email (mtodd@donordrive.com) or Slack (Michael Todd), and I'll share those two things, which you'll add to an .env.development.local file at the root level.
